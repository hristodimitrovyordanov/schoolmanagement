School management is a program that allows to create a school, 
and then you can create a classes, teachers and students. 
The program can run from 'Main.java' file. It will start 
with choosing a name for the school, and then you can navigate 
through menu like choosing corresponding number. 
You can start with creating of a class, teacher or student. 
If you create a school class, the diary of the school
class will be created automatically. Each school class 
can have a teacher that is responsible for this school class. 
Each teacher can have only one school class and also has 
a subject of teaching. You can create a class with, or without
a teacher and if class is created without teacher it can be added 
later. When student is created it can be added to the school 
class during the creation of the student, or it can be added later. 
The student can be removed from a class. The program allows existing
of students and teachers without a class. You can evaluate students
with different grades in different subjects. You can also edit the
grades - the programs allows to remove the last grade.
